Welcome to RAD CAD! 

RAD CAD is a SolidWorks add-in developed as part of the [Texas A&M Robotics and Automation Design Lab]("https://rad.engr.tamu.edu/"). RAD CAD seeks to automate the more repetitive or difficult tasks within SolidWorks using custom features and makes the CADing process easier, less stressful, and more consistent. It also makes editing complex designs (such as isogrid) easier, allowing those complex designs to be updated by simply changing a parameter instead of having to start over from scratch.

This website serves two primary purposes. It holds the installation files for RAD CAD and contains the documentation for each custom feature within RAD CAD. Installation is fairly easy and should work in theory for any somewhat recent edition of SolidWorks. The documentation for each custom feature can also be reached from the help icon (question mark) in the feature windows within SolidWorks itself.

My hope is that you find RAD CAD saves you a substantial amount of time and headaches when working with parts that make use of the custom features it provides.

â€‹Happy CADing!
