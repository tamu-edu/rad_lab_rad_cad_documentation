The RAD CAD installer works by adding dynamic link library (dll) files to the SolidWorks source files. This unfortunately requires administrative privileges. First download the zip file found below, then there are two options for installation.

Option one is to run the file called RUN_ME_as admin_to_install as admin. This will likely bring up a warning not to trust this program since it is a raw batch file, but you have to click run anyways and it will work. To find the "run anyways" button you may need to click a "more info" or some similar option on warning page that pops up

Option two is to open the RUN_ME file as a text file. This will let you see what the contents of the batch file are and verify that there is nothing malicious within it. You can then save this text file as a .bat file of any name. If you then put that .bat file in the folder where the RUN_ME file is and run it as admin it will install RAD CAD. This is essentially the exact same process as option one but it lets you verify that nothing sketchy is happening.
