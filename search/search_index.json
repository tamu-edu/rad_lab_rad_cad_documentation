RAD CAD seeks to automate the more repetitive or difficult tasks within SolidWorks using custom features and makes the CADing process easier, less stressful, and more consistent. It also makes editing complex designs easier, allowing those complex designs to be updated by simply changing a parameter instead of having to start over from scratch.</p> <p>This website serves two primary purposes: It holds the installation files for RAD CAD and contains the documentation for each custom feature within RAD CAD. Installation is easy and should work for version of SolidWorks after SW22. The documentation for each custom feature can be reached from the help icon (question mark) in the feature windows within SolidWorks itself.</p> <p>My hope is that you find RAD CAD saves you a substantial amount of time and headaches when working with parts that make use of the custom features it provides.</p> <p>\u200bHappy CADing! </p> <p>-Brae</p>"},{"location":"installation/","title":"Installation","text":"<p>The RAD CAD installer works by adding dynamic link library (dll) files to the SolidWorks source files.

This is a brief description of how it works in case it is relevent for debugging any issues: After entering the desired parameter values for width, height, and material thickness, the base sheet feature will start to get created. First the feature makes a non-sheet metal solid rectangular prism with the desired dimensions. It then selects the top face of the rectangular prism and converts it to sheet metal. This is why the design tree always shows a convert solid feature below the base sheet feature. This extra convert to sheet metal process is because SolidWorks does not easily allow for the direct create of a sheet metal part and this was an easier and more stable process to implement.</p> </li> <li> <p>After creation, if the feature is edited and the material thickness is changed, after the base sheet updates it will also go into the sheet metal folder in the design tree and change the material thickness stored there. This will update the material thickness for the entire entire part. This process of changing the sheet metal folder tends to cause the part to flicker as a graphical update when it the sheet metal folder updates.</p> </li> <li> <p>You should never have two base sheets in the same part.

Having two base sheets in one part means they will overlap and could cause some strange issues.</p> </li> <li> <p>When you edit the material thickness of a base sheet, there will be a short graphical update where the base sheet seems to move.

This could cause problems or confusion later so best practice is to just delete both the base sheet and the convert solid together if you delete the convert solid.</p> </li> <li> <p>This is a bit of an odd one, but if you delete the base sheet feature it is best practice to make sure you also delete the Sheet Metal folder. If you don't delete the sheet metal folder and insert a new base sheet and then try to edit the material thickness of the new base sheet, sometimes it will not update. This issue can be fixed by deleting the base sheet as well as the Sheet Metal folder and then inserting a fresh base sheet.

If you set up an assembly and edit a part in context, you can create rivets based on hole patterns in other parts.
