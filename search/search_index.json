RAD CAD seeks to automate the more repetitive or difficult tasks within SolidWorks using custom features and makes the CADing process easier, less stressful, and more consistent. It also makes editing complex designs (such as isogrid) easier, allowing those complex designs to be updated by simply changing a parameter instead of having to start over from scratch.</p> <p>This website serves two primary purposes. It holds the installation files for RAD CAD and contains the documentation for each custom feature within RAD CAD. Installation is fairly easy and should work in theory for any somewhat recent edition of SolidWorks. The documentation for each custom feature can also be reached from the help icon (question mark) in the feature windows within SolidWorks itself.</p> <p>My hope is that you find RAD CAD saves you a substantial amount of time and headaches when working with parts that make use of the custom features it provides.</p> <p>\u200bHappy CADing! </p> <p>-Brae</p>"},{"location":"installation/","title":"Installation","text":"<p>The RAD CAD installer works by adding dynamic link library (dll) files to the SolidWorks source files. This unfortunately requires administrative privileges. First download the zip file found below, then there are two options for installation.</p> <p>Option one is to run the file called RUN_ME_as admin_to_install as admin. This will likely bring up a warning not to trust this program since it is a raw batch file, but you have to click run anyways and it will work. To find the \"run anyways\" button you may need to click a \"more info\" or some similar option on warning page that pops up</p> <p>Option two is to open the RUN_ME file as a text file. This will let you see what the contents of the batch file are and verify that there is nothing malicious within it. You can then save this text file as a .bat file of any name. If you then put that .bat file in the folder where the RUN_ME file is and run it as admin it will install RAD CAD.

This is a brief description of how it works in case it is relevent for debugging any issues: </p> <p>After entering the desired parameter values for width, height, and material thickness, the base sheet feature will start to get created. First Aggie Toolbox makes a non-sheet metal solid rectangular prism with the desired dimensions. It then selects the top face of the rectangular prism and converts it to sheet metal. This is why the design tree always shows a convert solid feature below the base sheet feature. This extra convert to sheet metal process is because SolidWorks does not easily allow for the direct create of a sheet metal part and this was an easier and more stable process to implement.</p> <p>2) After creation, if the feature is edited and the material thickness is changed, after the base sheet updates it will also go into the sheet metal folder in the design tree and change the material thickness stored there. This will update the material thickness for the entire entire part. This process of changing the sheet metal folder tends to cause the part to flicker as a graphical update when it the sheet metal folder updates.</p> <p>3) You should never have two base sheets in the same part. Since base sheet is meant to be the starting point for a sheet metal part, it is created in the same location and orientation every time. Having two base sheets in one part means they will overlap and could cause some strange issues.</p> <p>4) When you edit the material thickness of a base sheet, there will be a short graphical update where the base sheet seems to move. This is a result of this feature updating the Sheet Metal's thickness and is nothing to be worried about. The base sheet will stay centered on the origin.</p> <p>5) If you delete the convert solid after the base sheet, the base sheet will act like a regular extrusion. This could cause problems or confusion later so best practice is to just delete both the base sheet and the convert solid together if you delete the convert solid.</p> <p>6) This is a bit of an odd one, but if you delete the base sheet feature it is best practice to make sure you also delete the Sheet Metal folder. If you don't delete the sheet metal folder and insert a new base sheet and then try to edit the material thickness of the new base sheet, sometimes it will not update. This issue can be fixed by deleting the base sheet as well as the Sheet Metal folder and then inserting a fresh base sheet. I honestly doubt this ever causes any problems for anyone, but it's a problem I ran into when stress testing this feature so I wanted to include it here.</p>"},{"location":"sheet-metal-features/bump-bend-feature/","title":"Base Sheet Feature","text":""},{"location":"sheet-metal-features/bump-bend-feature/#feature-overview","title":"Feature Overview","text":"<p>The bump bend feature creates many small sheet metal bends that act like one big bend of a large radius.

Real rivets of this kind have a domed head that is not modeled here.</p> <p>2) The rivet feature is meant to be used to check if rivets will fit or to animate the process of putting in rivets to an assembly. They should not be in parts that are sent to be manufactured so be sure to suppress or delete them before sending files to have parts be created.</p> <p>3) The rivet feature can be used within a part, but it can also be used from a different part similar to how cross drill is used. If you set up an assembly and edit a part in context, you can create rivets based on hole patterns in other parts. Aggie Toolbox will do all the math behind the scenes to make sure the rivets in the edited part line up with the hole pattern in the external part. This can be used to make rivets as a separate part and make it easier to animate assemblies to show how rivets can be used in the assembly process.</p> <p>4) If you are not using aluminum domed head blind rivets, be very careful when using the preset rivet types. Not all rivets with the same diameter are the same, and this might cause you to design parts that cannot actually be riveted together. If you are unsure if your rivets are the same as the preset ones in RAD CAD, I would recommend entering your values in the custom rivets option just to be safe.</p> <p>5) Rivets are not a joining body, meaning that even if they touch your sheet they should not fuse into it as one body</p>"},{"location":"sheet-metal-features/tab-feature/","title":"Rivets Feature","text":""},{"location":"sheet-metal-features/tab-feature/#feature-overview","title":"Feature Overview","text":"<p>The tab feature allows you to instantly make sheet metal tabs in a repeatable way.
